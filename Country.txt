[Verse 1] Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been [Refrain] And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls [Verse 2] Every light is burnin' in a house across town She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night [Refrain] And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls [Chorus] The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls [Verse 3] She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows [Refrain] And the thunder rolls And the thunder rolls [Chorus] The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls [Verse 4] She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again" 'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been [Chorus] The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes Another love grows cold on a sleepless night As the storm blows on out of control Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
[Verse 1] I went to work for her that summer A teenage kid so far from home She was a lonely widow woman Hell-bent to make it on her own We were a thousand miles from nowhere Wheat fields as far as I could see Both needing somethin' from each other Not knowin' yet what that might be [Verse 2] 'Til she came to me one evenin' Hot cup of coffee and a smile In a dress that I was certain She hadn't worn in quite a while There was a difference in her laughter There was a softness in her eyes And on the air there was a hunger Even a boy could recognize [Chorus] She had a need to feel the thunder To chase the lightnin' from the sky To watch a storm with all its wonder Ragin' in her lover's eyes She had to ride the heat of passion Like a comet burnin' bright Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night [Verse 3] That summer wind was all around me Nothin' between us but the night And when I told her that I'd never She softly whispered that's alright And then I watched her hands of leather Turn to velvet in a touch There's never been another summer When I have ever learned so much [Chorus] We had a need to feel the thunder To chase the lightnin' from the sky To watch a storm with all its wonder Ragin' in each others eyes We had to ride the heat of passion Like a comet burnin' bright Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night [Verse 3] I often think about that summer The sweat, the moonlight and the lace And I have rarely held another When I haven't seen her face And every time I pass a wheat field And watch it dancin' with the wind Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel Her hungry arms again [Chorus] She had a need to feel the thunder To chase the lightnin' from the sky To watch a storm with all its wonder Ragin' in her lover's eyes She had to ride the heat of passion Like a comet burnin' bright Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night [Outro] Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been Burnin' both ends of the night

A little baby told God Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if I wanna go down there Because from here it looks like a little blue ball But that's a great big place and I'm so small Why can't I just stay here with you? Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'

[Verse 1] Just the other night at a hometown football game My wife and I ran into my old high school flame And as I introduced them, the past came back to me And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be [Verse 2] She was the one that I'd wanted for all times And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then I'd never ask for anything again [Chorus] Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs And just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers [Verse 3] She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all [Bridge] And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife And then and there I thanked the good Lord, for the gifts in my life [Chorus] Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs And just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care 'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered... Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
[Verse 1] Sometimes late at night I lie awake and watch her sleeping She's lost in peaceful dreams So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark And the thought crosses my mind If I never wake up in the morning Would she ever doubt the way I feel About her in my heart? [Chorus] If tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her? Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one? And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes? [Verse 2] 'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life Who never knew how much I loved them Now I live with the regret That my true feelings for them never were revealed So I made a promise to myself To say each day how much she means to me And avoid that circumstance Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel [Chorus] 'Cause if tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her? Did I try in every way to show her every day That she's my only one? And if my time on earth were through And she must face the world without me Is the love I gave her in the past Gonna be enough to last If tomorrow never comes? [Outro] So tell that someone that you love Just what you're thinkin' of If tomorrow never comes

[Verse 1] We call them cool Those hearts that have no scars to show The ones that never do let go And risk the tables being turned We call them fools Who have to dance within the flame Who chance the sorrow and the shame That always comes with getting burned [Pre-Chorus 1] But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire 'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire [Verse 2] We call them strong Those who can face this world alone Who seem to get by on their own Those who will never take the fall We call them weak Who are unable to resist The slightest chance love might exist And for that forsake it all [Pre-Chorus 2] They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire [Chorus] Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire [Bridge 2] There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul Constantly yearning to get out of control Wanting to fly higher and higher I can't abide standing outside the fire [Chorus] Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire [Chorus] Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire [Chorus] Standing outside the fire Standing outside the fire Life is not tried, it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire
[Verse 1] She was a girl on a wagon train Headed west across the plains The train got lost in a summer storm They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home Then she saw him ridin' through the rain He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train And she looked down and her heart was gone The train went west but she stayed on In Lonesome Dove [Verse 2] A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand A blooming rose in a bed of sand She loved the man who wore a star A Texas Ranger known near and far So they got married and they had a child But times were tough and the west was wild So it was no surprise the day she learned That her Texas man would not return To Lonesome Dove [Chorus] Back to back with the Rio Grande A Christian woman in the devil's land She learned the language and she learned to fight But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights [Post-Chorus] In Lonesome Dove Lonesome Dove [Verse 3] She watched her boy grow into a man He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand He wore his star for all to see He was a Texas lawman legacy The one day word blew into town It seemed the men that shot his father down Had robbed a bank in Cherico The only thing 'tween them and Mexico Was Lonesome Dove [Verse 4] The shadows stretched across the land As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande And when the smoke had finally cleared the street The men lay at the ranger's feet But legend tells to this very day (Legend tells to this very day) That shots were comin' from an alleyway Though no one knows who held the gun There ain't no doubt if you ask someone In Lonesome Dove [Chorus] Back to back with the Rio Grande A Christian woman in the devil's land She learned the language and she learned to fight But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights [Post-Chorus] In Lonesome Dove Lonesome Dove

[Verse 1] Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder But that was years ago Last I heard she had moved to Boulder But where she's now I don't know But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year That spins my head around Takes me back, makes me wonder What's she doin' now? [Chorus] 'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows And I wonder if she knows, what she's doin' now [Verse 2] Just for laughs, I dialed her old number But no one knew her name Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered If she'd ever done the same I took a walk in the evenin' wind To clear my head somehow But tonight, I lie here thinkin' What's she doin' now?

[Verse] When the rain's blowin' in your face And the whole world is on your case I would offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love [Verse 2] When the evenin' shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love [Verse 3] I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong I've known it from the moment that we met It's no doubt in my mind where you belong [Verse 4] I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawlin' down the avenue There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love [Interlude] [Verse 5] The storms are ragin' on the rollin' sea Down on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowin' wild and free But you ain't seen nothin' like me yet [Verse 6] There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of the earth for you Make you happy, make your dreams come true To make you feel my... love
[Verse 1] He could see the storm clouds rollin' across the hill He barely beat the rain in from the field And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say "Damn this rain and damn this wasted day" [Verse 2] But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh-so-long She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while When their eyes met, they both began to smile [Chorus] Somewhere other than the night She needs to hear I love you Somewhere other than the night She needs to know you care And she wants to know she's needed, and she needs to be held tight Somewhere other than the night [Verse 3] They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket on the front porch swing He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things And there are times she feels alone even by his side It was the first time, she ever saw him cry [Chorus] Somewhere other than the night She needs to hear I love you Somewhere other than the night She needs to know you care And she wants to know she's needed, and she needs to be held tight Somewhere other than the night [Outro] To know she's needed, she needs to be held tight Somewhere other than the night
[Verse 1] I walked down to the park last night Warm breeze stirrin' up a soft moonlight And my mind started driftin' to way back when Yes, I do think about you, every now and then [Verse 2] The other day I saw a car like you used to drive I got a funny feelin' down deep inside And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin Yes, I do think about you, every now and then [Chorus] And I love my life, and I'd never trade Between what you and me had and the life I've made 'Cause she's here and she's real, but you were too And every once in awhile I think about you [Verse 3] I heard a song on the radio just yesterday The same one you always asked me to play And when the song was over I wished they'd played it again Yes, I do think about you, every now and then [Chorus] And I love my life, and I'd never trade Between what you and me had and the life I've made 'Cause she's here and she's real, but you were too And every once in awhile I think about you [Verse 4] I've been layin' here all night listenin' to the rain Talkin' to my heart, tryin' to explain Why sometimes I catch myself wondering what might have been Yes, I do think about you, every now and then [Outro] Every now and then
[Verse 1] She dropped her boy at school on time, one less worry on her mind Now it's off to work and on the radio Comes an old familiar song and then the D.J.'s voice comes on And say's he's back in town tonight for one last show [Verse 2] Her eyes well up with tears, God, could it be it's been ten years Since that autumn night outside the county fair When two strangers shared a night and in the darkness found a light That to this day is still alive and burning there [Chorus 1] And he asked her twice to come along They said goodbye at the break of dawn 'Cause you can't hold back the wind, and if it's meant to be again Then someday he'll find his way back to her arms [Verse 3] The marquee misspelled his name and not too many people came But that didn't matter to them They laughed and loved all through the night and as they faced the morning light They found themselves standing there again [Chorus 2] And he asked her twice to come along And they said goodbye at the break of dawn And as his bus left out she cried, with him standing by her side That old wind had once again found its way home [Outro] And someday he'll tell her about the money he hid And someday she'll tell him that the boy is his kid But for right now they are both in love, the only thing they are thinking of Is that they're finally where their hearts have always, been

[Verse 1] Once I had a little dog I called him Cracker Jack He had a spot around one eye That looked just like a patch His legs were way too long And he was awkward as could be He wasn't much to look at But he looked alright to me I found him by the river bank Just wandering about He was cold and hungry And his ribs were sticking out I snapped my fingers, whistled When he came, I picked him up I was just a kid And Cracker Jack was just a pup I took him home and fed him 'Til he couldn't eat no more I took him to my room And put a blanket on the floor After that beside my bed Is where he'd always sleep Each night in my prayers I'd pray the lord his soul to keep [Chorus] Cracker Jack The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack But he was more than that A playmate, a companion He was love and understanding That was Cracker Jack The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack But he was more than that Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack [Verse 2] Cracker Jack would run to meet me After school each day He'd jump and wag his tail And look at me as if to say "I love you and I've missed you And I'm glad you're home again" I knew just how he felt 'Cause me and Cracker Jack was friends Through the woods and fields We would often roam about And when we got in trouble We would help each other out I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run We had a lot in common And we had a lot of fun He was always with me When I was growing up We shared each other's good times And we shared each other's love He only lives in memories now But often I think back To the days of childhood The days of Cracker Jack [Chorus] Cracker Jack The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack But he was more than that A playmate, a companion He was love and understanding That was Cracker Jack The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack But he was more then that Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack

Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a-barkin' Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a-knockin' I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms Before I could say a word she said, "my name is Sandy And this here is my puppy dog, its name is little Andy" Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said "Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy? Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy? Patty cake and bakersman, my mommy ran away again And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do I wonder if you'll let us stay with you?" Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill Can we stay all night? If you don't love us no one will I promise we won't cry London Bridge is falling down My daddy's drunk again in town And we was all alone and didn't what we could do We wondered if you'd let us stay with you?
